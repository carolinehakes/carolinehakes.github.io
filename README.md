## Welcome to my GitHub Site 
I am a senior at George Washington University graduating at the end of December 2020. I majored in International Affairs and minored in Journalism. This site is a part of my final project for my Data Journalism class. We have been learning how to use R to analyze data and to build mini websites with R and Github. 

Below are three different projects I completed using R and GitHub over the course of the semester.

### White House Salaries
This is a project that took White House salary data and created a dashboard to comparies the highest raises

See the page in action [here](https://amkessler.github.io/whitehousesalaries).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/carolinehakes/carolinehakes.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
