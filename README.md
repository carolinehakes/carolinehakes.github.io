## Welcome to my GitHub Site 
I am a senior at George Washington University graduating at the end of December 2020. I majored in International Affairs and minored in Journalism. This site is a part of my final project for my Data Journalism class. We have been learning how to use R to analyze data and to build mini websites with R and Github. 

Below are three different projects I completed using R and GitHub over the course of the semester.


### Impeachment Data Project
For this project, I analyzed House Democrats' record on impeachment. I sorted through the data to obtain information about the demographics of their districts and past elections results.

## Biden Transition Data Project 
For this project, I had to scrape the Biden transition website to determine how many new White House staff and Cabinet appointees had been announced. We did an initial scrape in class together and later did one on our own to identify new appointees and hires.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/carolinehakes/carolinehakes.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
